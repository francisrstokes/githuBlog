  <title>Doing more than one thing at a time
</title>
  <description>How do computers run multiple independent programs at once? Maybe words like "multi-core" or "hardware threads" pop into your mind. These are some of the solutions of the modern age, which essentially just throw more hardware at the problem in order to achieve p...</description>

  <title>Notes on a lateral career move
</title>
  <description>I changed jobs recently. That's not all that uncommon for devs - in fact it's accepted wisdom that your best course of action is to switch every 2 years or so in order to maximise your salary. That may or may not be true, but it's not really the route I've taken. What was perhaps a little more unusual about my change was that I made a somewhat lateral move between fields of software engineering, from mostly web-based...</description>

  <title>Rolling your own crypto: Everything you need to build AES from scratch (and then never use it for anything of consequence)
</title>
  <description>You often hear the phrase "Don't roll your own crypto". I think this sentence is missing an important qualifier: "...and then use it for anything of consequence". If you are building a product or service, or are trying to communicate privately, then you should absolutely pick a vetted, open source, off-the-shelf implementation and use it. If, however, your goal is to learn, then there is honestly no better wa...</description>

  <title>Building A Jank UART to USB Cable From Scavenged Parts
</title>
  <description>My home "lab" is, unfortunately, a manifestation of the unwinnable, uphill battle against entropy. The latest victim to the sprawl of boards, prototypes, and other miscellanea was my little Adafruit CP2104 USB to serial converter. As far as I can tell, it has literally dropped off the face of the earth. This is particularly irritating as I'm in the middle of another project for an upcoming video on the \[channel]\(http...</description>

  <title>Why the CORDIC algorithm lives rent-free in my head
</title>
  <description>This post is an adaptation of a twitter thread I put together a few days ago.  CORDIC is an algorithm for computing trig functions like sin, cos, tan etc on low powered hardware, without an FPU (i.e. no floating point) or expensive lookup tables. In fact, it reduces these complex functions to simple addit...</description>

  <title>Everything I Know About The Fast Inverse Square Root Algorithm
</title>
  <description>The fast inverse square root algorithm, made famous (though not invented) by programming legend John Carmack in the Quake 3 source code, computes an inverse square root $\frac{1}{\sqrt{x}}$ with a bewildering handful of lines that interpret and manipulate the raw bits of float. It's wild....</description>

  <title>I sent an ethernet packet
</title>
  <description>For as long as I've been making videos on the low byte productions youtube channel, I've wanted to make a series about "Networking from scratch", by which I mean building a full TCP/IP stack from the ground up on a microcontroller. It's been nearly 6 years now, and the past few days felt like as good a time as any to start. This blog entry is fairly limited in scope; On the...</description>

  <title>I got an IP address
</title>
  <description>This is a follow up to a previous blog entry, I sent an ethernet packet. I'm writing a networking stack on a microcontroller. Not for production, or to make the fastest/smallest footprint/insert metric here, but just to get a deeper understanding about how things work all the way at the bottom, and hopefully to be able...</description>
